This repo contains a nice build script for libcurl on Android as well as prebuilt libs:

https://github.com/gcesarmza/curl-android-ios/tree/master/prebuilt-with-ssl/android

Do note that you might want to exclude protocols that you are not interested in 
by adding params such as â€”no-pop3 etc in the .sh file.
